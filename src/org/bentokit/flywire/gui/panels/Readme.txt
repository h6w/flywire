Compile DragLabel.java DropLabel.java and Test.java. Each class has
its own main method.  You can run both labels separately. Program
"Test" will make 3 DragLabels and 3 DropLabels each accepting
different operations - COPY, MOVE, COPY OR MOVE. Try dragging from
each source to each destination using various operations. The "drag
under" effects are a simple line border that is either red or green
for bad or good operations/flavors.

You might also try interacting with other programs. For example,
dragging to Word works (with the caveats in the article) but dragging
from word does not. Perhaps they will fix this in 1.2.1 (or is it
2.1?)

Dropping files selected from Windows explorer will be rejected since
they are not presented in a flavor that the DropLabel accepts. This
operation does work and will be the subject of a future article.

Have fun!
